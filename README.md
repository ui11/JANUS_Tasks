# JANUS_Tasks
For First Task,

I was asked to make an animated graph of Altitude vs Time and Velocity vs Time graphs, so, for learning basics of python, I watched the first lecture of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/weeks/0/) and [beginner course on Python by Freecodecamp on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw), and I learned about how to plot graphs by watching the attached [video in Problem Statement that was by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ercd-Ip5PfQ) that gave me pretty good knowledge about the task, but to actually write the code, I used the help of this [video](https://youtu.be/nT16-yQrnFk?feature=shared), which was sent by Raj Gupta iN the JANUS Enthusiasts group, but I didn't understand one part of code there, that was, fig, ax = subplots(), so I watched this [video](https://youtu.be/Tqph7_qMujk) and it gave me pretty decent clarity of what it actually influences in the code. So, now, about on how I tackled each problem given the task, first I made the program read the raw test flight data(possible via pandas), I then dealt with the blank data via .interpolate(), which fills the blank value with a known value between previous and next data(there was one problem that I encountered while using that data file, due to the stars filled in the blank space, it was giving errors, so i deleted the stars but kept that blank space since it was part of the problem, I've attached the modified .csv file in the Task_1 folder so you can check it out), after that I created a Time column with help of .index, then I created the Altitude and Velocity column too with help of the formula which i have told you about in the code(fyi, i have not made these changes in that .csv file but in the code), then I made the data of velcity and altitude smoother by taking average of certain of amount of the readings, then to animate the graph I used the help of the video sent by Raj Gupta that I told you about earlier. 
But my animation didn't work, to make that work, i used the help of the answers to [this question in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50928743/matplotlib-animation-not-displaying-in-pycharm).
I didn't focus on that [PQt5 link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwzapIxXRSQ) sent in the statement, so when I viewed it, I got no time in my hand to implement it in my code, sadly.
That's how I tackled the Task 1.

For Second Task, 

I was asked to make a code that use different color LEDs to indicate the state of the device, i.e., ascending, at apogee(peak), or descending and have a buzzer ring out loud at the apogee of the deviceâ€™s path. So for it, I took the help of TinkerCAD and Arduino, so to learn TinkerCAD, I viewed and couple videos from the [TinkerCAD playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV6cmKvnKRs5geApVORPW79U6s3wpa0Ht) shared to us in that problem statement, then I watched videos of [Parag Achaliya](https://www.youtube.com/@ParagAchaliya), I learned how to make the circuit of Force Sensor and Piezo Buzzer from him, to learn Arduino, I watched [the beginner course on Arduino by Freecodecamp](https://youtu.be/zJ-LqeX_fLU?feature=shared), so to tackle the problem first I took 2 separate readings with the help of analogue read, so that intial reading of pressure(via force sensor) was called previous and final reading of pressure(via force sensor) was called current, then I took their difference, then i defined threshold value which i took as a minimum change that will be considered as a real change, then I made an if else condition that will decide the state, so, if the difference was less than the negative of the defined threshold value, then that means pressure is decreasing by notable amount which means that the device is going up(i neglected the force by air resistance and considered pressure by atmosphere as the judging factor), if the difference was more than the positive of the defined threshold value, then that means pressure is increasing by notable amount which means that the device is going down, else it is at apogee, so when I ran the code, the leds n buzzer were responsive to even the slight move of the cursor of my mouse on force and it made me unable to view the changes properly, so i thought about taking the average(and that also helped me to smooth a data by a bit), then i defined function, in which i made a for loop which will add the data (read by analogRead) for a certain amount and after exiting the loop, the total value will be divided by the amount the loop ran giving us the average, then I used the same logic of difference of previous(prevAVG this time) and current(currAvg this time), and also used the same state judging condition, but this time, even if the device was coming to rest after descent, the code was giving the signal of apogee, so in the last else statement, i added another if else function inside it, i defined a variable called laststate, which is assigned a value after every state, then, if the device comes to rest, then it's previous state is checked, if it was ascending before or already at apogee then only the buzzer beeps and the designated led lights up, otherwise there is no response.
I also added some delay in the program which will provide us more ease in viewing the states.
That's how i tackled Task 2.

I typed the readme in quite a hurry so, I am really sorry for any grammatical mistakes.
Thank you!
